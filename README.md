# Functional js

This repo consists of some useful (and not that much useful) functions as well as examples how to use them.

I do respect all the fancy and packed with functionality libs out there, but the idea is to have a small set of functions that implement the very essence of functional javascript. Without unnecessary bells and whistles.

This is also for me to practice some academic knowledge from time to time :)
